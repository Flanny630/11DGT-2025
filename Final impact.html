            <p>
                Virtual Reality is not just for fun—it’s changing the way we live, work, and learn. Here are some ways VR is making an impact:
            </p>
            
            <h3>
                1. Gaming
            </h3>
            
            <p>
                VR gaming is one of the most popular uses. Players can feel like they’re inside the game, making it more exciting and immersive.

            </p>
            
            <h3>
                2. Education
            </h3>
            
            <p>
                Schools and universities are using VR to teach students in new ways. For example, instead of reading about space, students can "visit" planets and explore the solar system.
            </p>
            
            <h3>
                3. Healthcare
            </h3>
            
            <p>
                Doctors use VR to practice surgeries and help patients recover from injuries. It’s also used to treat phobias, like fear of heights, by slowly exposing patients to their fears in a safe environment.
                
            </p>
            
            <h3>
                4. Training
            </h3>
            
            <p>
                Pilots, soldiers, and even firefighters use VR to train for dangerous situations without any real-world risks.

                Conclusion:
            </h2> 
        
            <p>
                VR is still growing, and who knows what it will be used for in the future? Maybe one day, we’ll use VR to travel to faraway places or meet people from across the world without leaving our homes!
