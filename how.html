                    Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that tricks your brain into thinking you’re in a completely different place. It does this by creating a 3D virtual world that you can see, hear, and sometimes even touch. Here’s how it works step by step:
                </p>
                
                <h3>
                    1. The VR Headset
                </h3>
            
                <p>
                    The main piece of equipment is the VR headset. It's like a pair of goggles that you wear over your eyes. Inside the headset, there's a screen (or two screens, one for each eye) that shows you the virtual world. the screen is split into two images, one for each eye, which makes the world look 3D and realistic.

                </p>
            
                <h3>
                    2. Tracking Your Movements
                </h3>
            
                <p>
                    The headset has sensors that track your head movements. When you move your head up, down, or side to side, the sensors tell the screen to update the image so it feels like you’re actually looking around in the virtual world. Some VR systems also track your hands or body using controllers or cameras, so you can interact with objects in the virtual world.
                </p>
            
                <h3>
                    3. Sound and Touch
                </h3>
            
                <p>
                    To make the experience even more real, VR uses 3D sound. This means if something happens on your left, you’ll hear it from the left side of your headphones. Some advanced VR systems also include haptic feedback, which lets you feel vibrations or movements, like the rumble of a car engine or the recoil of a gun.

                <h2> 
                    Example: Playing a VR Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine you’re playing a VR game where you’re exploring a jungle. When you look around, the headset shows you the jungle in 3D. If you hear a bird chirping on your right, the sound comes from the right side of your headphones. If you reach out to touch a tree, the controllers let you feel like you’re actually touching it. It’s like you’re really there!
