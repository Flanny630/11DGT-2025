                    Virtual Reality, or VR, is <em>a technology that lets you experience a completely different world through a headset.</em> When you put on a VR headset, you can see and interact with a 3D environment that feels real, even though it’s not. It’s like stepping into a video game or a movie!
                </p> 
            
                <p>
                    VR is used for many things, like gaming, education, training, and even therapy. For example, doctors can use VR to practice surgeries, and students can explore ancient history by "visiting" old cities. It’s a fun and exciting way to learn and experience new things!

                <p>
                    Imagine you’re playing a VR game where you’re exploring a jungle. When you look around, the headset shows you the jungle in 3D. If you hear a bird chirping on your right, the sound comes from the right side of your headphones. If you reach out to touch a tree, the controllers let you feel like you’re actually touching it. It’s like you’re really there!

                    1. No single inventor: <br>
                    No single person is credited with inventing VR, as many people contributed to its development over time; the term "virtual reality" was invented in 1987 by Jaron Lanier.

                    2. Early beginnings: <br>
                    While VR seems like a new technology, the concept actually dates back to the 1960s with early prototypes being created then.

                    Beyond gaming, VR is heavily used in healthcare for training surgeons, providing pain management, and even aiding in rehabilitation.
